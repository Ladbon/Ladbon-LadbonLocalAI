Ladbon: I have a repo  https://github.com/Ladbon/Ladbon-LadbonLocalAI that I want to push to. How.

GitHub Copilot: To push your local repository to the GitHub repository `https://github.com/Ladbon/Ladbon-LadbonLocalAI`, follow these steps:

1. **Initialize Git (if not already initialized):**
   If your local repository is not already a Git repository, initialize it:
   ```bash
   git init
   ```

2. **Add the GitHub repository as a remote:**
   Add the GitHub repository URL as the `origin` remote:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/Ladbon/Ladbon-LadbonLocalAI.git
   ```

3. **Check the current status:**
   Check which files are staged or untracked:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```

4. **Stage your changes:**
   Add all files to the staging area:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

5. **Commit your changes:**
   Commit the staged files with a meaningful commit message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

6. **Push to the GitHub repository:**
   Push your changes to the `main` branch (or the default branch of your GitHub repository):
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

If you encounter any issues (e.g., authentication errors), ensure you are logged in to GitHub and have the necessary permissions. You may need to use a personal access token instead of your password if GitHub requires it. Let me know if you need help with any of these steps!

Ladbon: I tried using the gui after git remote add and git status (instead of git add .)

GitHub Copilot: It looks like Git doesn't know your identity, which is needed to make a commit. You'll need to configure your `user.name` and `user.email` for Git.

You can do this by running the following commands in your terminal, replacing `"Your Name"` and `"you@example.com"` with your actual name and email address:
 

Ladbon: I need a proper readme.md. Read the code and write me a beautifully written readme as to how to use this application.

A powerful Windows desktop application for running AI chat models completely locally using Ollama. Chat with state-of-the-art large language models on your own hardware with advanced capabilities like document analysis, image understanding, and web search integration.

## ‚ú® Features

- üß† **Multiple AI Models** - Support for Qwen3 (8B, 4B, 1.7B) and LLaVa (7B) models
- üìù **Document Context** - Analyze and discuss PDF, DOCX, and TXT files
- üñºÔ∏è **Image Understanding** - Two image modes:
  - OCR text extraction from images
  - Full image analysis and visual understanding (using LLaVa)
- üåê **Web Search Integration** - Research topics with DuckDuckGo search results
- üí® **Fast Chat Mode** - Quicker responses using lighter models
- üñ•Ô∏è **Dual Interfaces** - Choose between GUI and CLI

## üìã Requirements

- Windows 10/11
- [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/download) installed
- Python 3.8+ with pip

2. **Download Models**:
   ```bash
   ollama pull qwen3:8b
   ollama pull llava:7b    # Required for image analysis
   ```

3. **Clone and Setup**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/localai.git
   cd localai
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **For OCR Functionality** (optional):
   - Install [Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki)
   - Ensure it's in your PATH environment variable

## üíª Usage

### GUI Mode

Run the graphical interface:
```bash
python gui_app.py
```

The GUI provides:
- Model selection dropdown
- Input field for messages
- Document loading button
- Image analysis buttons
- Web search integration
- Settings panel

### CLI Mode

Run the command-line interface:
```bash
python main.py
```

You'll see a menu with these options:
1. Chat Mode (Qwen3)
2. Document Chat (Load & Discuss PDF/TXT)
3. Image OCR Chat (Extract & Discuss Text)
4. Image Analysis Chat (Describe & Discuss)
5. Web Search Chat (Research & Discuss)
6. Fast Chat (Qwen3 1.7B)
7. Clear History
8. Exit
9. Advanced Options

## üîç Advanced Features

### Document Analysis
Place PDF, DOCX, or TXT files in the docs directory and select them through the interface to analyze and discuss their contents.

### Image Processing
- **OCR**: Extract text from images for discussion
- **Visual Analysis**: Analyze image content using multimodal models (LLaVa)

### Web Search
Research any topic with integrated web search that provides relevant context to the AI for better responses.

### Performance Optimization
- Fast Chat Mode for quick responses
- Model unloading to save memory
- Advanced temperature and context length settings

## üì¶ Building an Executable

To create a standalone Windows executable:
```bash
python api/package.py
```
The executable will be created in the `dist/` directory.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

- **Ollama Connection Issues**: Ensure Ollama is running in the background
