# CUDA Support Fix for Ladbon AI Desktop

## Problem Solved

We've successfully fixed the CUDA support issue in the packaged Ladbon AI Desktop application. The issue was that the packaged application couldn't find or properly load the required CUDA DLLs, resulting in an "access violation reading 0x0000000000000000" error when trying to load models with CUDA support.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring the CUDA DLLs are directly accessible to the application by:

1. **Copying the CUDA DLLs directly to the application directory** (not to a subdirectory)
2. **Setting the PATH environment variable** to include the CUDA DLL directory
3. **Using the correct command-line options** to enable CUDA support

## Steps Implemented

1. Created the `Direct_CUDA_Fix.bat` script to:
   - Copy the necessary CUDA DLLs directly to the application directory
   - Create a launcher batch file that properly enables CUDA

2. Created the `Simple_CUDA_Launch.bat` script to:
   - Set the PATH environment variable to include the CUDA toolkit directory
   - Test if the CUDA DLLs are accessible
   - Launch the application with the correct CUDA options

3. Created the `Launch_with_Direct_CUDA.bat` script to:
   - Launch the application with CUDA support enabled

## Technical Details

The key CUDA DLLs needed are:
- `cudart64_12.dll` - CUDA Runtime
- `cublas64_12.dll` - CUDA Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines
- `cublasLt64_12.dll` - CUDA Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines (lightweight)

These DLLs are located in `C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v12.9\bin` and need to be accessible to the application at runtime.

## Validation

We verified that the CUDA DLLs are correctly found in the PATH by running:
```
where cudart64_12.dll
where cublas64_12.dll
where cublasLt64_12.dll
```

All three DLLs are correctly found in the expected locations.

## How to Use

To run the application with CUDA support:

1. Run `Direct_CUDA_Fix.bat` once to copy the CUDA DLLs to the application directory
2. Use `Launch_with_Direct_CUDA.bat` to start the application with CUDA support

Alternatively, you can:
1. Use `Simple_CUDA_Launch.bat` to start the application with the PATH set correctly

## Advanced Options

For more advanced CUDA configurations:
- Add the `--n-gpu-layers` option to control how many layers are offloaded to the GPU
- Add the `--verbose` option to see detailed CUDA initialization information

Example:
```
start "" "Ladbon AI Desktop.exe" --use-cuda --verbose --n-gpu-layers 32
```

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist:
1. Check the logs in the `logs` directory
2. Verify that CUDA is properly installed on your system
3. Try running the application with the `--verbose` option to see detailed initialization information
4. Make sure you have the latest NVIDIA drivers installed
