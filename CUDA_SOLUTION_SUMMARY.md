# CUDA/GPU Support Fix for Packaged Application

## Problem Summary

When packaging the application with PyInstaller, CUDA support was broken despite working correctly in the development environment. This was due to several issues:

1. Missing or incorrectly located CUDA DLLs
2. Incorrect DLL search paths
3. Python module loading issues
4. Pylance/linting errors in diagnostic code

## IMMEDIATE FIX FOR CUDA 12.9 (NEW)

We've identified that you have CUDA 12.9 installed. Here's the quickest way to fix the issue:

1. **Run `copy_cuda_dlls.bat`** - This will copy the necessary CUDA 12.9 DLLs to the application's lib directory.

2. **Launch the application using `Launch_With_CUDA.bat`** - This ensures the correct CUDA environment is set.

If the issue persists:
- Run `install_cpu_llamacpp.py` to switch to CPU-only mode
- Then rebuild the application with `python package.py`

## Solution Components

We've implemented a comprehensive solution:

### 1. Enhanced Diagnostic Tools

- **cuda_diagnostics.py**: A detailed diagnostic tool that checks CUDA environment, finds DLLs, tests llama-cpp initialization, and provides recommendations.
  
- **test_llama_cpp_cuda.py**: A test script that attempts to load llama-cpp with CUDA support and optionally test with a model.

### 2. Improved PyInstaller Integration

- **hook-llama_cpp_enhanced.py**: An enhanced PyInstaller hook that properly includes all necessary files and DLLs.
  
- **cuda_path_hook.py**: A runtime hook that ensures CUDA paths are correctly set up at application startup.

### 3. Helper Scripts

- **setup_cuda_for_app.bat**: Sets up the CUDA environment for the packaged app, copies required DLLs, and creates launcher scripts.
  
- **test_cuda_integration.bat**: Tests CUDA support in both development and packaged environments.

### 4. Code Fixes

- Fixed logger scoping issue in cuda_path_hook.py
- Fixed win32api optional dependency in diagnostic_script.py
- Fixed llama_backend_init parameter handling to work with different versions
- Fixed PyInstaller _MEIPASS attribute handling

## Usage Instructions

1. **Build the app with enhanced hooks**:
   ```
   python package.py
   ```

2. **Set up CUDA for the packaged app**:
   ```
   setup_cuda_for_app.bat
   ```

3. **Launch the app with CUDA support**:
   ```
   dist\Ladbon AI Desktop\Launch_with_CUDA.bat
   ```

4. **Test CUDA functionality**:
   ```
   test_cuda_integration.bat
   ```

5. **Diagnose issues if needed**:
   ```
   dist\Ladbon AI Desktop\Check_CUDA.bat
   ```

## Why This Works

Our solution ensures that:

1. All necessary CUDA DLLs are included in the package
2. DLL search paths are correctly set up at runtime
3. llama-cpp-python initialization correctly handles CUDA
4. Diagnostic tools help identify and fix any remaining issues

The key insight was understanding how PyInstaller handles DLLs and ensuring that both the DLLs themselves and the correct search paths are available at runtime.
